# Modelling_glaciers_TienShan
Datasets to model the evolution of six individual glaciers in the Tien Shan

Content of this repository:

1) The climatic datasets
* Kumtor-Tien Shan (3659 m), Chon-Kyzyl-Suu (2571 m), Golubin station (3300 m)
* Data is provided in timesteps of 3-hours.
* Temperature measured at 2m above the ground (Temp)
* Precipitation (Prec)
* Yearly (1 Oct - 30 Sept) precipitation (Pter)
* More information on the procedure to create hourly timesteps via https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6556313
* CMIP6 data for the different SSP scenarios is added (multi model mean) and can be downloaded via https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/search/cmip6/

2) The outlines of the ice masses (.shapefile).
* Adjusted outlines of the six ice masses based on UAV data and satellite data
* RGI outlines available through https://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0770/versions/6


4) The mass balance data are available through the WGMS website (https://wgms.ch/). Specific request for the mass balance measurements can be requested via lander.van.tricht@vub.be
   
5) Ice thickness reconstructions
   - The ice thickness reconstruction of the Grigoriev ice cap is available on https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7735970 (Van Tricht, 2023). Other data will be provided on request to the corresponding author.

6) Other data or model information can be requested via lander.van.tricht@vub.be
